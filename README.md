âœ¨ I am a Backend Engineer passionate about web and systems development, agile, data structures, and software engineering. I worked on some open-source projects. I'm open-minded and looking forward to working on more great projects.

I love sharing my knowledge with others, and I do that through content creation on my Blog and YouTube channel. I'm a Media Developer Expert at Cloudinary, an Auth0 Ambassador, and Nuxt.js Ambassador. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking about photography and exploring different ways of documenting stories using photography.
